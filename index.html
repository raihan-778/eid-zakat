            <h1>Why Do We Have to Give Qurbani?</h1>
            <p>
              The Qurbani story is a remarkable illustration of unconditional
              love and commitment. It speaks volumes of faith and devotion
              towards the Almighty, in every sense. It represents Prophet
              Ibrahim’s (AS) and Ismail’s unmatched loyalty and fervour towards
              their religion and their Creator.
            </p>

              <p>
                The significance of Qurbani in Islam holds great value and is an
                act of devotion towards Allah (SWT), but it is also an act of
                giving to others in their time of need. Traditionally, an animal
                that is slaughtered for Qurbani is divided into three shares:
                one share for the donor and their family, one share for the
                donor’s friends, and one share for someone in need.

                    Nisab is the threshold for which a Muslim’s personal wealth
                    must be above if he or she is to be eligible to pay Zakat.
                    There are two Nisab values from which the threshold is
                    determined.

                    You should pay your Zakat when your wealth has exceeded the
                    Nisab threshold for one full Islamic year from the point
